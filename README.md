## Introduction

In the fight against the spread of COVID-19, wearing face masks is a key preventive measure. The Face Mask Detection project leverages computer vision, deep learning techniques, and Streamlit for web-based interaction to determine whether individuals in images or videos are adhering to mask-wearing guidelines.

Our project provides a reliable and efficient solution for the automated detection of face masks and can be used in a variety of applications, such as monitoring public spaces, enforcing safety regulations, and ensuring the well-being of individuals in shared environments.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Detect face masks in real-time using your computer's webcam or video input.

- **Image Analysis**: Analyze static images to determine whether people in the images are wearing masks.

- **Web Application**: A user-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit for interacting with the detection system.

- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models for accurate mask detection.

- **Open Source**: Feel free to use, modify, and contribute to the project.
